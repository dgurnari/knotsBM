# Ball Mapper for Knot Theory data repository
---

This repository contains all data and scripts used in DÅ‚otko, Gurnari and Sazdanovic "Mapper--type algorithms for complex data and relations" 2023.

Because of GitHub's limits on file sizes, the complete data can be found at https://cloud.impan.pl/s/XEdAp6bHPGJHnEy 

The datasets we consider were originally created by J.S. Levitt https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10086 


## Code/Software

Scripts are provided in the form of Jupyter notebook. In addition to standard scientific packages, we use (Bokeh)[https://bokeh.org] to generate interactive plots. A standalone version of the (python Ball Mapper)[https://github.com/dgurnari/pyBallMapper] implementation is provided in the `src/` folder.
